## Goal
<b> To create and send an email with customizable input—including recipient email, subject line, email body, and image attachments—from a Gmail account, whose username and password are declared as environment variables </b>

## Methodology

* Retrieve the username and password of the user's email from environment variables
* Generate an EmailMessage object (from Python's Standard Library, "email")
* Prompt the user for the email's recipient, subject, and body
* Add the attributes above to the email
* Prompt the user to add any images to the email
  * Use the built-in add_attachment() method of EmailMessage to attempt to attach image files in the current directory to the email
* Send the email via SMTP (port 587)
  * Establish a connection to Gmail's SMTP server (smtp.gmail.com)
  * Enable TLS
  * Log into the user's Gmail account
  * Send the email message to the Gmail's server
  * Terminate the connection

[^1]: The module imghdr (a library used in the script) will be supported with Python ≥3.13; aside from this, there are no other dependency constraints.
